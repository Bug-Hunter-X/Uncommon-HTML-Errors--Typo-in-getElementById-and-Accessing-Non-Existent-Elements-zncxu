This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur in HTML.  The first error involves a simple typo in the `getElementById` method, while the second involves attempting to access and modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element.  The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected code and illustrates how to properly handle these scenarios.
